# WeatherPy


## Overview

### The purpose of our analysis was to use the weather description data you've already retrieved in this module to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. Then,have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta testers will then choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.


## Summary

### We have been able to generate a weather database map for using the Google Maps API as referenced below

### Pop Up markers were also generated using Google Maps API's to get a better picture of some vacation destinations using our coordinates
